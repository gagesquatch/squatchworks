                <p>
                    All of our food trucks are tailored around our customer’s individual needs and requests. No “cookie-cutter” designs are ever used. Each customer has direct input in not only determining their equipment selection but also in determining the amount of storage, shelving and refrigeration that will be available on their food truck.  By eliminating “cookie-cutter” designs and utilizing such things as a wide range of equipment options, as well as, ample storage, full size commercial refrigerators and even soda fountains, Premier Food Trucks are not only the most unique but also the most functional food trucks on the market.
                </p>


                <h3>Trailers</h3>

                <p>
                    Ranging in size from 6 to 28 feet, Premier has extensive experience in developing custom commercial kitchens. Built around each customer’s specifications, Premier built commercial kitchens can be set up to optimize your workflow and maximize your profits. Compared to traditional food trucks, trailers are ideal for stationary, high volume, locations. Capable of being outfitted with equipment you wouldn’t find in your average food truck, Premier food service trailers and mobile kitchens can be equipped with large ranges, stoves, grills, fryers, smokers and even ice makers that allow it to prepare a wider variety of menu items and offer superior versatility for high volume events.

                <p>
                    These mortgage alternatives are perfect for students, small families, single professionals, and even retiree’s. Why spend your days trapped to a huge mountain of debt when you can have an almost fully self-sustaining home for less than the down payment on a traditional house? These homes can range from 96 square feet to 320 square feet. Other sizes can be built, just let us know what you like! Most micro houses feature FULL SIZE amenities so you won’t sacrifice there. This isn’t your kid’s play house in the back yard, this is an actual, functional dwelling!
                </p>
                

                <h3>Mobile Retail Spaces</h3>

                <p>
                    Why lease 1600 square feet in some run down strip center for an arm and a leg when you can get your business mobile for a fraction of the cost and be in front of more people? Let us design you a custom mobile retail unit that will fit your needs and help you grow as a business. These trailers can be towed by a Honda Civic so you don’t need a huge pick up. Let us help you with your dream. We have built flea market trailers, farmer’s market trailers, event trailers, you name it. Everyone has a unique business and should have a unique trailer!
