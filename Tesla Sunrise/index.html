            <h3>Breakfast is our business, and business is booming.</h3>
            
            <p>One day I woke up hungry.  I wanted a big ol' country breakfast, but I
            didn't feel like cooking when I first got up, and I sure didn't want to
            get showered and dressed so early on my one day off just to go out to a restaurant.
            
            I wished there were some chefs, or maybe wizards, that would make me breakfast.
            Alas, there were none.
            
            I looked though my local phonebook for a breadfast delivery place.
            Finding none, I asked a friend who works in the delivery food business why
            no one delivered breakfast. I was informed that the first man who could figure out
            how to keep the eggs warm without overcooking them would basically have a license
            to mint money.</p>
