			<h2>WHO?</h2>
			<p>My name is Gage and this is my playground! I'm a sales associate by day, but by night (and weekends) I'm a web building wildman. I have a passion for pithy code and intunitive layout.  I believe in the KISS method.  That's right, Keep It Simple, Stupid.  In this modern world, mobile devices are becoming more popular. Therefore, simple layout and ease of use is more important than ever.</p>  
			
			<p>My time in sales has taught me that no matter how good your product is, it's of no use if your customer doesn't understand it or can't
			use it. That's why I focus on crystal clear, simple design, and straightforward usability.</p>

			<p>I have a professional understanding of front end development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.  If you're interested in starting a project, or (better yet) if you'd like to add me to your development team, please email me at the address below.</p>
